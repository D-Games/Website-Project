        <article class="introText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">I'm Dmitry, I have been working as a games developer in my spare time at home but am now looking for a new career opportunities.</h1><br><p>I've spent the past 3 years working on developing small indie games with a small team in my time outside of work. You can take a look at some of the projects I have worked on by going to the Project Gallery tab at the top of this page.
        <br><br>
        I currently work at Veeva Systems where I work as a Technical Analyst, helping new clients get familiar with our database features and helping existing clients by solving problems they may face using our applications such as techincal support using our software, quarterly releases, bug resolution etc.
        <br><br>
        Outside of my job and game development (which you can find more about on my Hobby Page), I enjoy gaming, hiking with my partner when the weather permits, and meeting up with friends and family.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">I started most of my journey at university, or at least the part that lead me to where I am today.</h1><br><p>I started my degree in BA Illustration in 2015 after finishing my A-levels first, followed by an art foundation year. Speaking truthfully, I failed my first year at uni mainly due to the lack of trying, it was a bit of a kick in the teeth but looking back at it, it was what I needed to get myself into gear.
        <br><br>    
        After completing the first year (a second time) I came to realise that my style was more suited to Graphic Design and took a year out to prepare my portofilio to switch degrees. I was accepted straight into the second year of Graphic Design after showcasing a strong line of work and self-learning, all while working a 9-5. It was during these years that I started to mature a little and realise there was more to life than parties and festivals (a favourite activity of mine at the time) and put my head down and prove to myself more than anything, that if I put my mind to it, I can achieve great things.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">My love for tech started to grow, starting with some of the projects I was able to do during my time at university.</h1><br><p>I came out of university starting at the bottom and coming out top of the class with one of the more "out-there" projects. Next Level Schools was my final year project, a showcase of a learning experience in Virtual Reality for students studying STEM subjects at GCSE level, in particular Chemistry.
        <br><br>
        Without going to much further into that topic, I mainly wanted focus on my strong interest in VR that was devloped while researching and executing that project. The more I learnt, the more I wanted to step into this industry and explore the possiblities of WEB3.0, or as some people may call it, the MetaVerse.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">Even if my application to this course is unsuccesful, I will find what I have learnt and projects I have completed to be a success in itself.</h1><br><p>The weeks/months I have spent working on these projects have been great fun, I started off with no knowledge in HTML, CSS or JavaScript and have come out with four projects that hopefully demonstrate my progression throughout the application progress. 
        <br><br>    
        I can use what I have learnt to create my own website which can be sent to potential employers to showcase my github projects with example code, and I will be able to add to my CV that I have a basic understanding of these three languages.
        <br><br>
        It feels like I have only scratched the surface of what can be made in HTML, so it would be wise of me to continue practicing what I have learnt and buidling upon the foundation of these four projects, adding to my collection of public projects on GitHub.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">As I write this bit about me and the progress of the projects, I wonder whether I should polish the first projects before the deadline to meet the same standards of the latest ones.</h1><br><p>I took the first month to learn what I could about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and Github while executing the first project, the Hobby Page. During this time I was heavily experimenting with what can be done in HTML and CSS, while trying to adhere to common practice techniques. Once I completed the project, I set it aside and planned out my timeline of would be the next 14 weeks, splitting each project into 3.5 week deadlines. I quickly executed the next 3 projects within the first 4 weeks and was left with 10 weeks to complete the game and add potential polish to the previous ones.
        <br><br>
        While I want everything to look it's best, it's interesting to see a comparison of where I started compared to what I am able to do now. Below I have added two images, the image on the left is the "before" screenshot of what the Hobby Page looks like, mainly focusing on the layout of the top of the page and elements such as the Header, overlaying text, image placement and colour choice. On the right is an "after" image of the Gallery Project which also focuses on the same elements for a direct comparison.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">I found learning JavaScript the trickiest part of the experience but probably the most useful.</h1><br><p>Learning how to handle data storage and add functionality to the frontend via JavaScript was probably the most satisfying aspect of these projects. While it took me a little longer to wrap my head around some of the concepts such as jQuery and localStorage, once I had a basic understanding I was able to problem solve a little easier with the help of StackOverflow and other online resources. I am still trying to understand the intricisies of Javscript and find it difficult to think of where to start in some cases when it comes to programming features, but I believe that as with many things, given a bit of time and practice I will be able to think of these solutions quicker.

        <article class="universityText"><h1 style="font-size: 42px;">After an attempt at game development, I found myself lacking some fundamental skills while also discovering that I enjoy coding more than I thought.</h1><br><p>I currently find myself in a job (Veeva Systems) that has little to no progression, mainly because it is a US based company, while also not fufilling my natural drive due to the lack of volume in work and mundane daily tasks. I love working around tech and while it has not been all bad by all means at this job, I am looking to progress my career in the tech industry and add some much needed skills to my repertoire. I still have a natural want to create and build things and after doing the research I found that software development is the perfect career path to work towards. 
        <br><br>    
        As a final note, as mentioned in the title above, I recently discovered my interest in programming via my hobby and took a few months prior to this application to think about where I want to be in the next few years. This lead me to deciding to follow a career in software development which required me to learn some new skills. That led me to find this course as a great starting point.
